I am a Ph.D. candidate in Managerial Economics and Strategy from Kellogg School of Management. **Currently on the 2025â€“2026 academic job market.**

My research interests are in corporate finance, political economy, and public economics. My research explores how oversight institutions shape firm behavior in environments with limited monitoring capacity and institutions vulnerable to corruption or capture. I study how transparency requirements, enforcement mechanisms, and political access influence firms' strategic decisions and market outcomes. I combine quasi-experimental designs with novel datasets to capture forms of misconduct and institutional response that are typically hard to observe.
